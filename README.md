# SolGeneos Custom Monitors

## What is this repository?

The [Solace Geneos Agent (a.k.a SolGeneos)](https://docs.solace.com/SolGeneos-Agent/SolGeneos-Overview.htm) allows for the monitoring of Solace [Event Brokers](https://solace.com/what-is-an-event-broker/) in the [Geneos](https://www.itrsgroup.com/products/geneos) monitoring tool by [ITRS](https://www.itrsgroup.com/).  
While coming with a large number of [dataviews](https://docs.solace.com/SolGeneos-Agent/Default-SolGeneos-Agent-Data-Views.htm) to monitor various product aspects such as pending messages on queues, health of the underlying hardware, and connectivity status to other event-brokers, SolGeneos is an extendable framework that allows customers to [build additional monitors](https://docs.solace.com/SolGeneos-Agent/Monitor-Dev-and-Deployment.htm) for dataviews containing metrics specific to their own requirements.

This repository contains further examples of custom monitors that can support monitor development efforts by customers.
